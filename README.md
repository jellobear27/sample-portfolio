## Description


- As a New Web developer, I wanted to make a responsive landing page using semantic HTML and CSS. 
- I wanted my landing page to include an about me section followed by links that will show case my projects in the futute. The Current links are responsive and include some imgaes that give away hints as to what I will be working on later. I have also included a section at the footer for placeholder contact information. 
- Building this landing page has helped me realise how much time I will need to invest into my coding skills.
- While working on the css, I learned that nesting divs is a great way to handle sizing and resposive flow of the site layout. 

## Installation

To get the project up and running simply clone this Git Hub repository, then open index.html with a live server of choice.
